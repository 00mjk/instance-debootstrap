Version 0.4
-----------

This version fixes the problem of interface renaming at instance import
time, by removing the saved udev hotplug rules (if any).

Version 0.3
-----------

The OS will cache the image of the first instance it installs using the
name "cache-$arch.tar" (where $arch is what dpkg --print-architecture
returns) on a node-by-node basis. This cache will be then used on the
future installs, speeding them greatly (even with a fast mirror). Feel
free to remove the cache at any time, or to copy it to all nodes. The
cache will be kept for two weeks, after which the first install will
recreate the cache (in order not to use old packages). If you don't care
about package age, remove the user write permission (chmod u-w) from the
cache and ganeti will continue to use the same file without refreshing
it.

If you don't have enough space and don't want cache creation, just touch
the file 'no_cache' - this will prevent the creation, but the script
will continue to use a cache if it exists (but it will remove an
existing one after two weeks).

Also note that if the image file is there, the script does not need
network access at all.
