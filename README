This is a guest OS definition for Ganeti (http://code.google.com/p/ganeti).
It will install a minimal version of Debian Etch via debootstrap (thus it
requires network access). This only works if you have a Debian-based
node or you have debootstrap installed by hand on another distribution.

You need to put these files in a directory under /srv/ganeti/os on all the
nodes of the cluster (e.g.  /srv/ganeti/os/debian-etch).

Notes:
 - no password for root; simply login at the console
 - no network interfaces defined (besides lo); add your own definitions to
   /etc/network/interfaces
