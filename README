This is a guest OS definition for Ganeti (http://code.google.com/p/ganeti).
It will install a minimal version of Debian Etch via debootstrap (thus it
requires network access). This only works if you have a Debian-based
node or you have debootstrap installed by hand on another distribution.

You need to put these files in a directory under /srv/ganeti/os on all the
nodes of the cluster (e.g.  /srv/ganeti/os/debian-etch).

Notes:
 - no password for root; simply login at the console
 - no network interfaces defined (besides lo); add your own definitions to
   /etc/network/interfaces

Since version 0.3, the OS will cache the image of the first instance it
installs using the name "cache-$arch.tar" (where $arch is what dpkg
--print-architecture returns). This cache will be then used on the
future installs, speeding them greatly (even with a fast mirror). Feel
free to remove the cache at any time, or to copy it to all nodes. The
cache will be kept for two weeks, after which the first install will
recreate the cache (in order not to use old packages). If you don't care
about package age, remove the user write permission (chmod u-w) from the
cache and ganeti will continue to use the same file without refreshing
it.

If you don't have enough space and don't want cache creation, just touch
the file 'no_cache' - this will prevent the creation, but the script
will continue to use a cache if it exists (but it will remove an
existing one after two weeks).

Also note that if the image file is there, the script does not need
network access at all.
